### Installation:
- Make sure you have [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava), [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) and [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) installed on your system.
- backup your current config files, and then copy all of the folders (apart from the Scripts folder) into the `~/.config/` directory.
- Put the Scripts folder in your HOME directory.
- Make all the files in the Scripts folder executable by running `chmod +x ~/Scripts/*.sh`
- The rofi config isn't very good, I'd recommend [this repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) instead, it's what I'm currently using.
